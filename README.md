# Shirley Xia - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Shirley! I have a background in Biological Sciences and I recently completed a 200-hour Data Analytics Apprenticeship with COOP Careers. COOP Careers is a nonprofit organization that helps diverse, upwardly mobile college graduates overcome underemployment by teaching them digital skills and exposing them to peer connections. Through this apprenticeship and self-studying, I have developed proficiency in Data Analytics tools such as: Microsoft Excel (VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables) for data exploration and summarization, SQL for developing queries, Python (specifically Pandas) for data manipulation such as data cleaning and preprocessing, and Tableau for data visualization.

I have developed a strong foundation in life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions. I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am excited to bring both my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst. 

This is a repository to share my data analysis projects and showcase my knowledge.
