# Shirley Xia - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Shirley, and welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases projects I've completed using Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. 

I recently completed a rigorous 200+ hour data analytics apprenticeship program at COOP Careers, equipping me with the essential skills to launch a career in data analytics. COOP Careers is a nonprofit organization that helps diverse, upwardly mobile college graduates overcome underemployment by teaching them digital skills and exposing them to peer connections. Through this apprenticeship and self-studying, I'm proficient in a range of data analytics tools including Microsoft Excel (VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables) for data exploration and summarization, SQL for creating queries, and Python (Pandas and Matplotlib) for data manipulation and data visualization. Additionally, I'm familiar with Tableau for creating data visualizations and interactive dashboards.

Furthermore, I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Biological Sciences from SUNY Binghamton. My experience in gathering data, identifying patterns, and drawing conclusions for scientific research projects has shown me the commonalities between the two fields. 

## Portfolio Projects
