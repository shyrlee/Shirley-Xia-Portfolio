# Shirley Xia - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Shirley! Welcome to my portfolio. This repository is for showcasing the projects that I've completed using Python, SQL, Excel, and/or Tableau. 

Although I have a background in Biological Sciences, I recently completed a 200-hour Data Analytics Apprenticeship with COOP Careers. COOP Careers is a nonprofit organization that helps diverse, upwardly mobile college graduates overcome underemployment by teaching them digital skills and exposing them to peer connections. Through this apprenticeship and self-studying, I have developed proficiency in Data Analytics tools such as: Microsoft Excel (VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables) for data exploration and summarization, SQL for developing queries, Python (specifically Pandas) for data manipulation such as data cleaning and preprocessing, and Tableau for data visualization.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list projects I've completed and give a brief summary
