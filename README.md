# Shirley Xia - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Shirley, and I'm excited to present my portfolio! Within this repository, you'll find a collection of projects that I've completed using Python, SQL, Excel, and/or Tableau.

I recently completed an intensive 200+ hour data analytics apprenticeship program at COOP Careers. This transformative experience equipped me with the essential skills needed to kickstart a career in data analytics. COOP Careers, a nonprofit organization, focuses on empowering diverse, ambitious college graduates by imparting digital skills and fostering valuable peer connections.

Throughout my apprenticeship journey and self-guided studies, I've become familiar with several data analytics tools:

**Microsoft Excel:** For data exploration and summarization, utilizing features such as VLOOKUP and Pivot Tables
<br>
**SQL:** Creating queries to extract valuable insights from databases
<br>
**Python:** Using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
<br>
**Tableau:** Crafting data visualizations and dashboards (business intelligence tool)

My academic foundation includes a Bachelor of Arts in Biological Sciences from SUNY Binghamton. This background has provided me with a strong grounding in scientific research and data analysis. I've discovered that the skills and methodologies I applied in scientific research beautifully align with those in data analytics.

Feel free to explore my portfolio to see how I've applied these skills to various projects. I'm excited about the opportunity to start my journey in the world of analytics.
