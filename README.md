# Shirley Xia - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Shirley! Welcome to my portfolio. This repository is for showcasing the projects that I've completed using Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. 

I recently completed a rigorous 200+ hour data analytics apprenticeship program at COOP Careers, equipping me with the essential skills to launch a career in data analytics. COOP Careers is a nonprofit organization that helps diverse, upwardly mobile college graduates overcome underemployment by teaching them digital skills and exposing them to peer connections. Through this apprenticeship and self-studying, I'm proficient in a range of data analytics tools including Microsoft Excel (VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables) for data exploration and summarization, SQL for creating queries, and Python (Pandas and Matplotlib) for data manipulation and data visualization. Additionally, I'm also familiar with Tableau for creating data visualizations and interactive dashboards.

Furthermore, I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Biological Sciences from SUNY Binghamton. My experience in gathering data, identifying patterns, and drawing conclusions for scientific research projects has shown me the commonalities between the two fields, further enhancing my analytical capabilities.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list projects I've completed and give a summary

### Mental Health in US Tech Companies
**Code:** 

**Goal:** The goal of this project is to analyze the data to identify patterns, trends, and factors influencing mental health in tech companies across the United States. I created a dashboard using Tableau highlighting the 3 main influences on mental health interference reports: age, gender, and location.

**Description:** This was a team project I completed as a data analyst apprentice at COOP Careers. I worked in a team of 5 to analyze the data, draw insights and conclusions, and present our findings to our cohort. The dataset has data collected from a survey in 2014, measuring the attitudes towards mental health and the frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace globally. For our project, my team decided to focus on tech companies solely in the United States and we cleaned the dataset accordingly and each member was assigned a different question to answer.

### Exploratory Data Analysis on Data Analytics Salary
**Code:** [Salary Analysis on Colab](https://github.com/shyrlee/Shirley-Xia-Portfolio/blob/main/Salary%20Analysis/Salary%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** The goal of this project is to do exploratory data analysis and discover trends and patterns with the data. By performing data cleaning and analysis using Python, this project aims to provide valuable insights through data visualization about the salary differences between data analytics professionals.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of salary information about data analytic professionals collected between 2020 and 2022. The dataset included job titles, salary, salary currency, company location, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Language:** Python (Pandas and Matplotlib)
