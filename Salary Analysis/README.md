**Skillsets:** 
- Python: data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib

**Goal:** The goal of this project is to do exploratory data analysis and discover trends and patterns regarding salary differences between data analytics professionals. This project involved merging 5 different datasets from separate .csv files to create a cleaned and processed new .csv file for analysis and visualization. 

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of salary information about data analytic professionals collected between 2020 and 2022. The dataset included job titles, salary, salary currency, company location, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, data preprocessing (cleaning, transforming, manipulating, and validating data), performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating data visualizations.

**Conclusion:** From the analysis, I found that data analysts make the most in the United States, with an average salary of $117,000, while data analysts make the least in Pakistan, with an average salary of $8,000. Additionally, data architecture is the highest-paying job category compared to other data analytic professionals in 2022. And almost 70% of companies are working remotely.
