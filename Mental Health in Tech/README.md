**Skillset:** 

- Data cleaning with python (pandas)
- Data analysis
- Data visualization with Tableau

**Goal:** The goal of this project is to analyze the data to identify patterns, trends, and factors influencing attitudes towards mental health in tech companies across the United States. I created a dashboard using Tableau highlighting the 3 main influences reporting mental health interferences: age, gender, and location.

**Description:** This was a team project I completed as a data analyst apprentice at COOP Careers. I worked in a team of 5 to analyze the data, draw insights and conclusions, and present our findings to our cohort. The dataset has data collected from a survey in 2014, measuring the attitudes towards mental health and the frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace globally. For our project, my team decided to focus on tech companies solely in the United States and we cleaned the dataset accordingly, each member was assigned a different question to answer. 

**Conclusion:** After analyzing our data, we found that the factors that influence attitudes toward mental health include gender, age, geographical location, and employer benefits and resources. People are more receptive and open-minded to topics that they are exposed to, thus prompting mental health as an essential component of a healthy work environment. My team and I gathered that more mental health workshops are needed to break the mental health stigma, especially for men. In addition to workshops, creating safe spaces for employees to express and share their emotions where they can find their community within the workplace is also important for a positive and productive environment.
